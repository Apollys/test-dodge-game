# Apollys's Test Game

A basic test game to be used as a platform for machine learning.

Uses the [keyboard](https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard/tree/master/keyboard) package by broppeh (which I have also included in this repository).

Tested with Python 3.6, should be compatible or almost compatible with Python 2, but not guaranteed that every update will be tested with both versions of Python.
